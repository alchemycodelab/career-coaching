# Community Involvement

This course is a solid introduction to the technical skills that it takes to be a part of the web development world.
However, technical proficiency on its own won't make you a "great" programmer.
A large part of being a great programmer is being involved in your community.
As a junior developer, you become acquainted with some of the higher concepts and larger players in the local web dev community as well as in the global programming space.
As an intermediate developer, regular participation in things like meetups and conferences keep your name in circulation and keep your skills relevant as you learn about subjects outside of your job responsibilities.
As a senior developer, you get in touch with less-experienced developers in your field, nurturing the next generation of programmers.
Everyone wins when we get involved in the community, so we figure we should give you incentive to get out and join the fray.

## What's a Meetup?

Meetups take a couple of different flavors.
You've got your monthly-ish local area meetings, and you've got your more-regular programming nights.
At the monthly-ish meetings you'll see local programmers give short or long talks about whatever strikes their fancy.
You'll learn about new topics in the field, or get reinforced on some common problems that programmers face.
Finally, and most importantly, it's your first real networking opportunity as a developer.
Concerned that you don't know enough or aren't skilled enough to "deserve" to be a part?
It's ok, meetups are oftentimes very welcoming to beginners!
It's a good time for most and entirely worth an evening or two.

The programming nights are as they sound: nights where folks get together after work and chisel away at some project.
Most people have things to work on, but that doesn't mean that they're not open for conversation or willing to give a little help!
Oftentimes the people that attend these programming nights go just so they can meet new developers and help them work through their programming problems.

## Where to Find/Which Ones to Attend?

[Calagator](https://calagator.org) Is an excellent resource to discover additional tech meetups around Portland. 

[Portland Tech Jobs](http://portlandtech.org/) Also lists events, but is an even better place for researching companies in town by tech stack or job role. 

[Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) is a great site for finding a local meetup, and there's a group for most technologies or tech topics you may be interested in.
Here are a few:

- Free or discounted tickets to conferences
- [PDX Women In Technology](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Women-in-Technology/): We are a community-based non-profit organization. Our purpose is to strengthen the Portland women in tech community. We encourage women and other under-represented groups who are in or around tech and their allies to join us! Trans and non-binary people are always welcome. PDXWIT hosts excellent job seeker networking events. They fill up quickly, so RSVP in advance.
- [Portland ReactJS](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-ReactJS/): This is a group for anyone who has experience working with the Facebook React library or would like to learn more about it. We (usually) host meetings on a monthly basis. There is room for reactivists to share their war stories, give lightning talks, share cool tricks/projects and more.

Developers and aspiring developers, please! Find us on Twitter @PyLadies_PDX. We have guides and other set-up materials on Github (https://github.com/pyladiespdx) as well.

    We typically meet every other Tuesday and most Saturdays, and we host three types of meetings:

* We feature three to four speakers each month. We aim to feature one technical talk, one creative talk, and one passion talk, though most talks usually aren’t so narrow.
* Our talks cover a wide range of topics: introductions to programming languages and deep dives on development methodologies, people-focused project management and sustainable hiring practices, mental health in tech, accessibility on the web, using JavaScript to make music an art in the browser, and much more.
* We’ve proudly hosted many first-time speakers and well-known personalities in tech.

## Submitting Your Assignment

We want you to network and grow your community, and want you to start doing so in the next four weeks. However, it often takes some time to get comfortable networking, so we want you to get your feet wet and attend a few meetups. Your goal for the meetups this time around is to really observe the atmosphere, listen to talks if they have them, and get a feel for the community you dropped in on. Often times, it takes a few times at a networking event to start to interact and build your community, so we'd just like you to observe at the very least. Once you're in Bootcamp II, you'll have more technical knowledge to start talking tech! You'll have already developed one app, and well on your way to start your second. 

Before the end of the course, you are to attend two meetup events at one of the above (or other related) meetup groups.
Take a screenshot of **your** RSVP to the meetup group event.
You are to include this screenshot as a file upload along with your report of the event, outlined below.

**If you went to a larger monthy meetup:** Submit in text the titles of the talks you heard. Write about what you found interesting (or uninteresting) about the subject matter of the talks, as well as anything else notable about the meetup.

**If you went to a programming/hack night:** Submit in text what you worked on, and if you had any interesting conversations or anyone provided you with some significant help, note that as well.
