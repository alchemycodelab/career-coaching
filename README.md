# Career Coaching at Alchemy Code Lab

## Career Launch Strategy
All of your Alchemy Code Lab courses will focus on the importance of being a professional to prepare you for the job market. We'll connect the WHY of what you are doing here with how it will help you be successful in a career after you are finished with Alchemy. In the next four weeks, we want you to think about what you can do to be a professional who can ask the right questions and be a contributor when you go on to your first job.

## Professionalism. First steps are to think about the following: 
**Be on time to all meetings** and your obligations here at Alchemy. Not only does the state require it, but when you are in your new position at the end of the program, people will notice if you are perpetually late or leaving early. Make a good impression.

**Always respond in a timely manner.** Whether professionally or in job search, responding in an appropriate amount of time shows interest, responsibility, and business acumen. If you make a connection or someone is introduced to you for a potential job, informational interview or whatever the case may be, show interest and excitement. If someone asks you for your resume, it’s because they are looking to make a hire soon. They want it now. Please respond appropriately. In some instances, it should be pretty immediate without coming across less than stellar, and at least no longer than 24 hours. If career services makes an introduction for you, you need to respond within 24 hours.

**Attire, presence, and grooming should always be considered.** Know your audience, and dress appropriately. Companies vary on their daily dress, and always put your best foot forward. Suits and ties are generally not needed, but be prepared with some pressed shirts or tops, nice pants, and good shoes. Not only will you make a good impression when meeting professionals and interviewing, you will also feel good. It’s even recommended to clean up and put on nice clothes if you have a phone interview as it will make you feel that part, let alone act it.

**Reflect on past experiences.** Take some time to think about the jobs or work that you did prior to entering Alchemy. What were great qualities you, your leaders or your peers have that will be of value to you in your new career? What could you do better?

**To obtain employment,** it is vital that your professional pitch is ready, you understand the power of your network, how to target companies for placement, you have your materials ready, and you show excellent professional competence. Our curriculum is built in collaboration with industry partners, who are committed to bringing people from all backgrounds into the tech workforce. They have shared with us the insider secrets and best practices of how to land a great job in tech. We have aggregated and synthesized this knowledge into a guide to attaining employment, with step by step assignments utilizing internal and external resources, in parallel with your technical training at Alchemy Code Lab.

You are expected to complete these assignments, and you will continue to be given career guidance only if you do. Each assignment is graded, and together all Career Coaching assignments make up 10% of your overall course grade. Although your submissions will be graded, **the most important goal is for you to be prepared to meet potential employers and get hired.** 

Also, being prepared will help you to be compfortable and ready to interact well with people you meet. You **NEVER** know when you might start a conversation with someone that can help you achieve your goals. It could be in a coffee shop, a bar, the grocery store, a hair salon and more. Keep your ears and eyes open for opportunities.

It’s also good to recognize that we all represent each other. When Alchemy provides you with connections, please respond in a timely manner and put your best foot forward. Representing us well will help us continue to offer future students and even others in your cohort more opportunities.
